# StandUP

## Overview
Welcome to StandUP - a reminder app designed to aid users in maintaining a healthy balance between sitting and standing while working, particularly with standing desks. This project was undertaken as a personal endeavor to learn Kotlin and Android development while addressing the need for regular posture changes in desk-bound routines.

## Purpose
The primary goal of StandUP is to serve as a reliable reminder for users to adjust their standing desks periodically, promoting healthier work habits by alternating between sitting and standing positions. By utilizing the phone's acceleration sensor, the application aims to detect the direction of movement—upwards or downwards—to infer whether the user is in a sitting or standing position.

## Features (Planned)
- **Reminder Notifications:** A planned feature to send timely reminders, prompting users to adjust their standing desks at customizable intervals.
- **Customizable Intervals:** Users will have the ability to set the frequency of reminders based on their preferences and work routines.

## Technology Stack
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Platform:** Android
- **Sensors:** Acceleration sensor

## Usage
To use StandUP:
1. Download the APK or clone the repository.
2. Install the app on your Android device.
3. Grant necessary permissions for sensor access.
4. Configure reminder intervals as desired.
5. Let StandUP prompt you for posture changes and enjoy healthier work habits!

## Future Enhancements
StandUP is an ongoing project, and potential future improvements may include:
- Implementing reminder notifications and customizable intervals to facilitate better posture management.
- Refining accuracy in detecting posture changes using additional sensors or algorithms.
- User interface enhancements for better usability.
- Integration with health-tracking platforms to provide insights into posture habits.
